<h2>Planetary Hours</h2>

<p>
Planetary hours are a traditional system of sacred timekeeping.
Each day is ruled by one of the seven classical planets.
The hours themselves are governed in sequence by the Chaldean order.
</p>

<p>
The day begins at sunrise, not midnight.
The first hour after sunrise is ruled by the planet of the day.
Each hour that follows proceeds in the ancient planetary order.
</p>

<p>
Daytime and nighttime hours are unequal.
Each is divided into twelve parts based on the actual motion of the Sun.
This makes planetary hours living and variable.
</p>

<p>
These hours have been used for ritual work, contemplation, study, and timing
for over two thousand years.
</p>

<p>
This application calculates planetary hours using real solar motion
and astronomical planetary positions.
