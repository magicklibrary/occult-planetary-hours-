## Usage for Magical Practice

### Timing Magical Operations

Planetary hours provide optimal timing for magical work. Each hour carries the specific energy of its ruling planet:

- **Saturn Hours**: Bindings, banishing, discipline, long-term planning, necromancy
- **Jupiter Hours**: Prosperity, legal matters, expansion, wisdom, oaths
- **Mars Hours**: Courage, conflict, protection, energy work, exorcism
- **Sun Hours**: Authority, success, illumination, healing, solar talismans
- **Venus Hours**: Love, beauty, reconciliation, art, harmony
- **Mercury Hours**: Communication, divination, learning, travel, commerce
- **Moon Hours**: Dreams, psychic work, intuition, scrying, lunar magic

### Electional Considerations

The application calculates planetary strength based on:

1. **Essential Dignity**: Whether the planet is in exaltation, detriment, or fall
2. **Natal Resonance**: Alignment between the transiting hour and your birth chart
3. **Day/Night Sect**: Some operations are stronger during day or night hours

Hours marked as "Optimal" in the Electional view are particularly favorable for ceremonial work.

### Ritual Workflow

1. **Select Your Hour**: Choose an appropriate planetary hour for your intended operation
2. **Prepare Materials**: Gather corresponding incense, crystals, and tools
3. **Review Ritual Instructions**: Study the hexagram patterns and divine names
4. **Perform the Operation**: Use the provided invocations and ritual structure
5. **Scrying (Optional)**: Enter scrying mode for divination or vision work

### Natal Chart Integration

By entering your birth data, the application identifies hours when planetary positions resonate with your natal chart. These hours are particularly powerful for:

- Personal development work aligned with your birth planets
- Strengthening specific areas indicated by your chart
- Timing operations for maximum personal efficacy
